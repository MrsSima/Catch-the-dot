# Catch the Dot

This is the game written with Vanilla JS. 

### Rules
Dot appears in random place on the page. 
When user clicks the dot, it disseaprs, one point is added to the score and new dot appears.
The more dots in the row are clicked, the faster they fall. Once dot falls to the bottom, score and dot's speed resets.

### Hardcore mode

Toggle in the top right corner switches the game to the hardcode mode. 
The only difference between normal mode and hardcore mode is that missclick resets the game. 

### Have fun!
